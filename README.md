# Quantum Game Theory
This project was [initially developed](https://github.com/qiskit-community/qiskit-camp-europe-19/issues/40) at the IBM Q Qiskit Europe (2019) hackathon and has expanded since.

## Tutorial
A tutorial Jupyter Notebook can be found [here](https://github.com/desireevl/quantum-game-theory/blob/master/notebooks/quantum_game_theory.ipynb) which explains what a game theory game is as well as what a quantum game theory game is and how you can study and execute these using Qiskit. It will also offer some insight as to the differences and advantages of both classical and quantum game theory.

## Playable Game
If you are just interested in getting your hands on a way to play the game, there is a [user-interface](http://quantum-game.desireevl.com/) where you can simply select the kind of game you would like to play (and adjust desired properties) and run the quantum circuit!

## Quantum Game Theory

[Game theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game_theory) is the study of mathematical models of strategies that players take in certain environments (e.g. Prisoner's Dilemma). [Quantum game theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_game_theory) is the study of more generalized game theory models that make use of quantum computation. The project implements a framework which can be used to spin up quantum game theory models.
